# APY (API)

A base source code for creating APIs, powered by [Bun](https://bun.com) runtime.

Install dependencies with:

```bash
bun i
```

Running the client:

```bash
bun client
```

Compile the client to deploy:

```bash
bun client:compile
```

If you want to use Biome.js in your editor, run `bun fmt` to format the code.
